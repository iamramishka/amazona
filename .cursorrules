# Cursor Rules

## Instructions

- Record fixes for mistakes or corrections to avoid repetition in the `Lessons` section.
- Organize thoughts and plan steps before starting a task in the `Scratchpad` section.
- Clear old tasks if necessary.
- Use todo markers for progress tracking:
  - `[x]` Completed tasks
  - `[ ]` Pending tasks
- Update Scratchpad after completing subtasks.
- Reflect and plan after milestones for better task management.
- Always refer to Scratchpad before planning the next step.

## Lessons

1. Use `npx shadcn@latest add [component]` instead of `npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component]` when installing Shadcn UI components.
2. In Next.js 14+, page props params must be typed as a Promise. Example:
   ```typescript
   type tParams = Promise<{ id: string }>
   interface PageProps {
     params: tParams
   }
   ```
   Then await the params in the component:
   ```typescript
   export default async function Page(props: PageProps) {
     const { id } = await props.params
   }
   ```
3. Use `const session = await auth()` instead of `const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)` for Next.js authentication. The new `auth()` function is the recommended way to get the session in Next.js Auth v5.
4. When importing `useRouter` from 'next/navigation', the component must be marked as a client component using the `'use client'` directive at the top of the file, as this hook only works on the client side.
5. When creating layouts in Next.js 14+, use the `(group)` folder naming convention to organize related routes without affecting the URL structure.
6. For sticky headers with backdrop blur, use the following classes:
   ```tsx
   className="sticky top-0 z-50 w-full border-b bg-background/95 backdrop-blur supports-[backdrop-filter]:bg-background/60"
   ```
   This provides a modern, translucent effect with fallback for browsers that don't support backdrop-filter.
7. When implementing forms with React Hook Form and Zod, use the following pattern for better type safety and validation:
   ```typescript
   const schema = z.object({
     field: z.string().min(1, 'Field is required'),
   })
   type FormValues = z.infer<typeof schema>
   const form = useForm<FormValues>({
     resolver: zodResolver(schema),
     defaultValues: {
       field: '',
     },
   })
   ```
8. For responsive grid layouts, use the following pattern:
   ```tsx
   className="grid gap-6 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3"
   ```
   This creates a single column on mobile, 2 columns on medium screens, and 3 columns on large screens.
